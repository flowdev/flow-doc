// Flow contains data for a whole flow.
// The data is organized in rows and individual shapes per row.
// Valid shapes are Arrow, Comp, Split, Merge, Sequel and Loop.
//
// The following rules apply:
// - Arrows and Comps alternate.
// - Instead of a single Arrow a Split can be used for multiple Arrows.
//   So the first element of such a split is always an Arrow.
//   (exception: a component that completes a merge).
//   Such a split has to be the last element of a row.
//   A split can never be the first element of a row.
// - The last Comp (and element) in a row can instead be a Merge.
//   The real Comp for the merge has to be the first element of a future row
//   (possibly of the outer Split).
//   Of course multiple merges can "point" to the same Comp (using the same ID).
//   The same Merge instance has to be used for this (only 1 instance per ID).
// - The real Comp of a merge can be followed by an Arrow or Split as usual.
// - The last Comp (and element) in a row can be replaced by a Loop, too.
//   The loop points back to a component we can't draw an arrow to.
//   In the diagram you will see: ...back to: <component>:<port>
// - The first and last Comp and element of a row can instead be an OuterPort.
// - The last Comp (and element) in a row can also be replaced by a Sequel.
//   The other part of the Sequel should be at the start of one of the next rows
//   of the outer Split.
//   Sequels are in general inserted by the layout algorithm itself.
